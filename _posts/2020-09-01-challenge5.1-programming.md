Turing machine
  <li>Let L be the set of Turing machine codes M such that L(M) contains at least two strings. By Rice's theorem, L is not recursive. Show that L is recursively enumerable by constructing a Turing machine that accepts L. The description can be informal. Just remember to give the key ideas so the reader is convinced you understand how the TM works.</li>
