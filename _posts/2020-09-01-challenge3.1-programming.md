<ol>
  <li>Arithmetic expressions with operator + and parentheses can be generated by the grammar </li>
  
  <li>E -> E+E | (E) | a </li>
  <li>where a  is intended to represent any number.  A typical string in the language is a+(a+a).  This grammar is ambiguous. </li>
  <li>(a) Give an example of a string that has two or more leftmost derivations or parse trees.  </li>
  <li>(b) Design an unambiguous grammar for the same language.  </li>
</ol>
