This week, we have three challenge problems. The first is of medium difficulty, and the second is hard.  The third is very hard, and it doesn't really deal with automata.  Rather, it is a good opportunity to increase your understanding of dynamic programming algorithms, something that we will see in Week 4, as well as learning about recurrences and recursive algorithms.   Relevant background includes Ch. 2, Ch. 3, and Sect. 6.9 of the free on-line book Foundations of Computer Science.
The contact part of the index page is consisted of two elements:

<ol>
  <li>1. A finite automaton A, Text</li>
  <li>2. Two particular states p and q of A, and </li>
  <li>1. A finite automaton A, Text</li>
  <li>3. A regular expression E, </li>
</ol>

tells whether there is any string in L(E) that takes state p to state q in A.
