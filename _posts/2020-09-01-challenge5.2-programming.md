Turing machine
  <li>Devise an encoding with a finite alphabet for all context-free grammars with terminal alphabet {0,1}. Remember that CFG's may have any number of variables, so you will have to find a naming system for them. Incidentally, you can extend the encoding (but you don't have to in this problem) so the grammars may have any terminal alphabet. But since the encoding must use a finite alphabet, you would not be able to retain the identity of the terminal symbols. Thus, for example, {0n1n | n >0} would look like the same language as {anbn | n > 0}. For most purposes that is not important. For example the test for emptiness of a CFL does not really depend on what the terminals are named.</li>
