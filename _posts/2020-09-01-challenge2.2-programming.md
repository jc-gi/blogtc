Define HALF operation on a language L: 

<ol>
  <li>1. HALF(L) = {x | there exists a string y such that xy is in L and |x|=|y| }</li>
  <li>2. Prove that if L is regular, so is HALF(L).  </li>
  <li>Example: if L = {0010, 10, 010}, then HALF(L) = {00, 1}.  </li>
  <li>Note that 010, being of odd length, yields nothing for HALF. 0010 yields its first half: 00, and 10 yields its first half: 1. </li>
</ol>

Note: Because the construction for this operation is so interesting and complex, we shall sketch a solution in the third Problem Session (part of Module 4).
