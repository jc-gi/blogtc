The operation HALF(L), discussed in Challenge Problem 2.2,
<ol>
  <li>The operation HALF(L), discussed in Challenge Problem 2.2, is { w | for some x with the same length as w, wx is in L}. While regular languages are closed under HALF, CFL's are not. Give an example of a CFL L such that HALF(L) is not a CFL. Prove that your language L is a CFL by describing a CFG or PDA for L. Prove that HALF(L) is not a CFL by whatever means you find appropriate, e.g., using the pumping lemma and/or applying some CFL-preserving operation to HALF(L) to produce a language known not to be a CFL. </li>
