TThe Quadratic Allocation 

  <li>1. Nonnegative integers a and b,  </li>
  <li>2. A list of integers i1, i2,..., ik, and  </li>
  <li>3. An integer limit l (ell),  </li>
  <li>4. A value vi for each node ni,  </li>
  <li>can we select a subset of the integers on the list i1, i2,..., ik, such that the sum of ai+bi2 over all selected integers i equals the limit l? Note: all integers are assumed represented in binary for this problem.  </li>
  <li>Is the Quadratic Allocation Problem NP-complete or is it in P? Either give a reduction to show it is NP-complete or give a polytime algorithm to solve it. </li>

 
</ol>
Aside: This problem arose during some consulting I was doing, where the integers represented the sizes of different software jobs, and the quadratic term is there because the cost of implementing software goes up faster than linearly with the size of the job.
